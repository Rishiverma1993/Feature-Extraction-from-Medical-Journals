# Feature-Extraction-from-Medical-Journals
The increasing number of biomedical articles and resources, searching for and extracting valuable information has become challenging.




# PROJECT CHARTER PURPOSE
Manual annotation and feature generation by biomedical experts are inefficient because they involve a complex process and require expensive and time-consuming labour. Therefore, efficient and accurate natural language processing (NLP) techniques are becoming increasingly important for use in computational data analysis, and advanced text mining techniques are necessary to automatically analyse the biomedical literature and extract useful information from texts. To bridge the gap between academic development and industrial requirements, we are developing  a web application that recognizes and extracts the entities from the content which helps to minimize time commitments from domain experts and the manual efforts on researching content.

# Future Scope
Different journals can be used as input to extract the entities and retrieve the information
The drugs extracted can be linked to a site that gives more information like the uses, side effects, alternate drugs, etc.
Information gathered from the journals can be used to validate the new journal of its content
The entities extracted from different journals can be used to find new information about the entities
