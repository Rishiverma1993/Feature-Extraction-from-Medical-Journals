# Feature-Extraction-from-Medical-Journals
The increasing number of biomedical articles and resources, searching for and extracting valuable information has become challenging.




PROJECT CHARTER PURPOSE
Manual annotation and feature generation by biomedical experts are inefficient because they involve a complex process and require expensive and time-consuming labour. Therefore, efficient and accurate natural language processing (NLP) techniques are becoming increasingly important for use in computational data analysis, and advanced text mining techniques are necessary to automatically analyse the biomedical literature and extract useful information from texts. To bridge the gap between academic development and industrial requirements, we are developing  a web application that recognizes and extracts the entities from the content which helps to minimize time commitments from domain experts and the manual efforts on researching content.
