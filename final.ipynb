Selectins comprise a family of adhesion receptors expressed by leukocytes, platelets and\\nendothelial cells. In this study, the serum levels of soluble L-selectin and P-selectin were measured in\\npatients with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and Hodgkin’s disease and found to be signiﬁcantly elevated\\nin both patient groups compared to healthy controls. This result provides evidence that alterations in\\nthe expression and function of adhesion molecules may play an important role in the progression of\\nlymphomas. Further studies are awaited to establish the exact roles of these adhesion molecules in\\ndistinct patterns of growth and spread of lymphomas.\\n\\nKey words: L-selectin; P-selectin; Hodgkin’s disease; non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.\\n\\nINTRODUCTION\\n\\nAdhesion of lymphocytes to endothelium is essential in lymphocyte trafﬁcking\\n[1, 2]. Lymphocytes migrate from the circulation by selective attachment to spe-\\ncialized endothelial cells lining the postcapillary high endothelial venules (HEV)\\nin organized lymphoid tissues, lymph nodes and Peyer’s patches. Selectins com-\\nprise a family of adhesion molecules which have been demonstrated to participate in\\nthe initial tetherting/ rolling of leukocytes on activated endothelium [3]. L-selectin\\n(CD62L, LAM-1, LECAM-1) mediates the binding of lymphocytes to HEV of\\nperipheral lymph nodes through interactions with corresponding endothelial lig-\\nand and therefore also known as the lymphocyte homing receptor [4]. P-selectin\\n(CD62P, PADGEM, GMP-140) is stored both in the alpha granules in platelets and\\nWeibel-Palade bodies of endothelial cells [5] and involved in the stabilization of\\n\\n(cid:3)\\n\\nTo whom correspondence should be addressed.

A\\nsimilar adhesion mechanism is also utilized by malignant lymphoid cells during\\ndissemination [7, 8]. Altered expression patterns of adhesion molecules appear\\nto be involved in the spread of lymphoid malignancies and Hodgkin’s disease\\n(HD) [7–10]. In this study, serum levels of soluble L-selectin and P-selectin were\\ndetermined in patients with HD and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) and in normal\\nhealthy individuals.\\n\\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\\n\\nThe study group consisted of 17 patients (10 NHL, 7 HD; 11 men, 6 women; median\\nage 35 years, range 19– 70) and 15 healthy volunteers (11 men, 4 women; median\\nage 49 years, range 36– 67). Out of 10 NHL patients, 5 were classiﬁed as low-\\ngrade, 1 intermediate, and 4 high-grade according to the Working Formulation.\\nFour patients out of 7 with HD had mixed cellularity, 1 nodular sclerosis, and\\n2 lymphocyte predominance type. Staging was performed according to the Ann\\nArbor system.\\nIn NHL, 2 patients had stage III and 8 patients had stage IV\\ndisease, and in HD 1 patient had stage II, 2 stage III, and the remaining 4 stage IV\\ndisease. All patients with HD and 3 out of 10 with NHL had B-symptoms. Serum\\nL-selectin and P-selectin levels were determined using a commercially available\\nELISA kit (Bender MedSystems, Vienna, Austria) according to the manufacturer’s\\ninstructions. Data are presented as mean (cid:6) SD. Mann–Whitney U test was used\\nfor statistical analysis.\\n\\nRESULTS\\nAdhesion molecule levels were signiﬁcantly higher in lymphoma patients compared\\nto healthy controls (Table 1) (Fig. 1). Serum levels of sL-Selectin (1137 (cid:6)\\n428 ng/ml vs 625 (cid:6) 159 ng/ml; p D 0:0023 and sP-Selectin (610 (cid:6) 211 ng/ml\\nvs 178 (cid:6) 48 ng/ ml; p D 0:0001) were signiﬁcantly increased in patients with\\nnon-Hodgkin’s lymphoma compared to the control group. In HD, serum soluble\\nL-selectin (1140 (cid:6) 498 ng/ml; p D 0:0082) and P-selectin (875 (cid:6) 370 ng/ ml;\\np D 0:0002) concentrations were signiﬁcantly elevated also compared to healthy\\ncontrols (625 (cid:6) 159 ng/ ml and 178 (cid:6) 48 ng/ml for L-selectin and P-selectin,\\nrespectively).\\n\\nDISCUSSION\\n\\nDisseminating malignant lymphoma cells and lymphocytes share several character-\\nistics, including migration and extravasation involving adhesive interactions [7, 8].\\n\\n\\x0cAdhesion molecules in lymphomas\\n\\n29\\n\\nTable 1.\\nSerum soluble P-selectin and L-selectin levels in the study group\\n\\nPatients\\n\\nHD\\nHNL\\nControls\\n\\nP-selectin (ng/ml)\\n875 (cid:6) 370\\n610 (cid:6) 211\\n178 (cid:6) 48\\n\\n* Compared with healthy controls.\\n\\n(cid:3)\\n\\np\\n\\n0.0002\\n0.0001\\n\\nL-selectin (ng/ml)\\n1140 (cid:6) 498\\n1137 (cid:6) 428\\n625 (cid:6) 159\\n\\n(cid:3)\\n\\np\\n\\n0.0082\\n0.0023\\n\\nFigure 1. Circulating soluble P-selectin and L-selectin levels in the study group.\\n\\nEmerging evidence indicates that the adhesion molecules governing the homing\\nof normal lymphocytes also mediate the dissemination of their neoplastic counter-\\nparts. Adhesion molecules have also been demonstrated to function in the spread\\nof HD [9, 10]. Therefore, we determined serum levels of soluble adhesion mole-\\ncules, L-selectin and P-selectin as indicators of distinctive clinical and biological\\nbehaviour of lymphoid malignancies.\\nIn this report we demonstrated that serum\\nconcentrations of these adhesion receptors are increased in patients with HD and\\nNHL. Our results conﬁrm and extend data published previously on the role of dis-\\ntinct adhesion molecules in lymphomas. Elevated levels of circulating intercellular\\nadhesion molecule-1 were reported in various hematologic malignancies including\\nHD [9, 10], acute lymphoblastic leukemia [10], chronic lymphocytic leukemia [11]\\nand NHL [12, 13], and non-hematologic malignancies [10, 13]. To our knowledge,\\n\\n\\x0c30\\n\\nI. C. Haznedaroˇglu et al.\\n\\nthis report is the ﬁrst investigating the levels of circulating L-selectin and P-selectin\\nin NHL and HD.\\n\\nDifferential expression of these adhesion molecules may account for diverse\\npatterns of growth and dissemination of lymphomas. The study of adhesion\\nmolecule expression and function may allow a better understanding of the malignant\\nbehavior of lymphoid cells. Our data need to be validated and extended in a\\nmore homogenous patient series in order to elucidate the clinical and prognostic\\nsigniﬁcance of L-selectin and P-selectin in lymphomas.\\n\\nREFERENCES\\n\\n1.

Methods: The randomized study included 82 patients with a first \\nacute myocardial infarction treated with a stent implantation. This presentation is a subanalysis of 47 \\npatients with left ventricular dysfunction–EF (ejection fraction) ≤ 40%. Group H patients (n = 17) received \\nhigher number (100,000,000) of cells; Group L patients (n = 13) received lower number (10,000,000) of \\ncells. The patients of control Group C (n = 17) were not treated with cells. The Doppler tissue imaging \\nand single photon emission computed tomography were performed before cell transplantation and 3 \\nmonths later. Results: At 3 months of follow-up, the baseline EF of 35%, 36%, 35% in Groups H, L, and \\nC increased by 6% (P < 0.01 vs. baseline), 5% (P < 0.01 vs. baseline), and 4% (P = NS vs. baseline), \\nrespectively, as assessed by single photon emission computed tomography (P = NS between groups). The \\nbaseline number of akinetic segments of 6.9, 7.0, and 6.2 in H, L, and C groups decreased by 1.7 (P < 0.01 \\nvs. baseline), 1.5 (P <  0.01 vs. baseline), and 0.7 (P =  NS vs. baseline, P =  NS between groups), \\nrespectively, as demonstrated by echocardiography. Conclusion: In our study, the statistically important \\neffect of transplantation of mononuclear bone marrow cells on myocardial function was not found. Only \\nan insignificant trend toward the improvement of global LV EF fraction was found at 3-month follow-up. \\n(ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY, Volume 25, September 2008)  \\n\\nartery \\n\\ndisease \\n\\nPostmyocardial  infarction  congestive  heart \\nfailure  remains  to  be  a  major  clinical  problem, \\ndespite advances in the medical and sur  \\n\\nstem cells, coronary artery disease, left ventricular dysfunction \\nCoronary \\nfor \\napproximately  50%  of  all  cardiovascular  deaths \\nand  is  the  leading  cause  of  congestive  heart \\nfailure.

The  num  bers  of \\npatients  included  are  relatively  small.  Many  of \\nthese studies are not randomized. The type and \\namount of cells that are necessary to implant to \\nreally regenerate damaged my ocardium are not \\nknown.  \\n\\nAt present, we do not know the mechanism of \\naction of the implanted cells in studies that found \\nimprovement in myocardial function or perfusion \\nfollowing  the  cell  therapy.  Recently,  several \\nexperimental  projects  described  no  or  only \\nnegligible transdifferentiation of adult stem cells \\ninto  the  myocytes.27–30  The  benefit  of  cell \\ntransplantation may be induced by the paracrine \\nstem cell effect.31,32  \\n\\nStudies in Patients with Acute Myocardial \\nInfarctions  \\n\\nTransplantation of mononuclear bone mar row \\ncells into the region of infarcted my ocardium has \\nbeen  previously  suggested  as  a  promising \\nalternative \\nfor \\ntricle \\nresults  of \\ndysfunction.  Nevertheless, \\n\\nleft  ven \\nthe \\n\\ntreatment \\n\\nrandomized studies are controversial.3,4,7–9 Some \\nof  them  indicated  that  patients  with  the  most \\ndepressed  left  ventricular  contrac  tile  function \\nhad  the  greatest  improvement  in  contractile \\nfunction  after  intracoronary  admin  istration  of \\nbone marrow cells. For example, REPAIR-AMI,33 \\nso  far  the  largest  randomized  multicenter  “cell \\nstudy,”  showed  significantly  greater  increase  in \\nthe  global  left  ejection  frac  tion  in  the  bone \\nmarrow  cell  group  (5.5%  vs.  3.0%  in  the  control \\ngroup)  at  4  months  follow  up.  Higher  impact  of \\ncells was found among pa tients with a baseline \\nleft ventricle ejection frac tion below the median \\nvalue  (48.9%).  In  these  patients,  the  absolute \\nincrease  in  ejection  frac  tion  was  three  times \\nhigher  that  in  the  placebo  group  (7.5%  as \\ncompared  with  2.5%;  absolute  difference:  5.0%). \\nAmong patients with a base line ejection fraction \\nabove  median,  the  abso  lute  difference  between \\ngroups  was  only  0.3%  (4.0%  vs.  3.7%).  Similar \\nobservations  were  pre  viously  described  in \\nTOPCARE-AMI  trial,34  in  which  baseline  left \\nventricle  ejection \\nthe  only \\nsignificant predictor of improve  \\n\\nfraction  was \\n\\nment in ejection fraction during the 4-months \\nfollow-up.  \\n\\nIn  the  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo \\ncontrolled  study  of  Janssens  group,35  in  67  pa \\ntients  with  ST-elevation  myocardial  infarction \\ntreated  with  coronary  intervention,  no  effect  of \\nautologous  bone  marrow-derived  stem  cell \\ntransfer  on  left  ventricle  ejection  fraction  was \\nfound.  However,  the  treatment  was  associated \\n\\n\\x0cwith a significant reduction in myocardial in farct \\nsize  and  better  recovery  of  regional  sys  tolic \\nfunction.  The  effect  of  treatment  on  the \\nprobability  of  improvement  in  regional  function \\nshowed  a  predominant  interaction  in  the  most \\nseverely  affected  segments.  In  addition  to  that, \\non  positron  emission  tomography  examination, \\npatients with larger myocardial infarction had a \\ngreater  increase  in  metabolic  activity  after  cell \\ntherapy than after placebo infusion.  \\n\\nOn  the  other  hand,  BOOST  trial  36,37  did  not \\ndescribe  the  inverse  relation  between  baseline \\nleft  ventricular  ejection  fraction  and  absolute \\nimprovement of the left ventricle function af ter \\nimplantation  of  the  bone  marrow  cells  into  the \\ninfarcted  myocardium.  At  6-month  follow  up, \\npatients in a control group of this study im proved \\ntheir  ejection  fraction  from  51.3%  to  52%  (0.7% \\nabsolute  change),  while  the  bone  marrow  cell \\ngroup  from  50.0%  to  56.7%  (6.7%  absolute \\nchange). The bone marrow cell subgroup pa tients \\nwith ejection fraction of the left ventri cle > 52% \\nincreased  their  ejection  by  8.0%,  but  patients \\n\\nwith ejection fraction ≤ 52% only by 4.5%.  \\n\\nThe main limitation of these studies is the fact, \\nthat  patients  with  only  mild  left  ventricu  lar \\ndysfunction were included.  \\n\\nStudies in Patients with Moderate-to-Severe \\nLeft Ventricular Dysfunction  \\n\\nThere are only few trials studying cell ther apy \\nin  patients  with  moderate-to-severe \\nleft \\nventricular  dysfunction  and  their  results  are \\ncontroversial  too.

Improvement versus baseline val ues \\nwas  found  in  both  groups,  but  they  did  not \\nsignificantly  differ.  Results  were  consistent  for \\nall  the  three  methods.  No  improvement  in  car \\ndiac function was also found in Kuethe et al.38 in \\ntheir study with five patients with a large acute \\nanterior myocardial infarction and intracoro nary \\nmononuclear bone marrow cell implanta tion.  \\n\\nIn  our  previous  study,12  the  significant  and \\ndose-related  improvement  was  found  in  the  re \\ngional systolic function of the infarcted wall af ter \\ncell transplantation. As compared to con trols, a \\nhigher cell dose significantly improved global LV \\nsystolic  function.  Both  cell doses  pre  vented  the \\nleft  ventricle  from  the  dilation,  while  the  end-\\ndiastolic  volume  significantly  increased  in  the \\ncontrol group. Because patients with the greatest \\ndamage  to  their  myocardium  are  the  ones  who \\nneed  treatment  most,  the  substudy  of  these \\npatients  was  performed.  In  this  sub  study  the \\nstatistically  important  effect  of  au  tologous \\ntransplantation  of  mononuclear  bone  marrow \\ncells  on  myocardial  function  was  not  found  in \\npatients with moderate-to-severe left ventricular \\ndysfunction.  Only  an  insignificant  trend  toward \\nthe prevention of the left ventric ular dilatation \\nand improvement of global left ventricle ejection \\nfraction was found at 3-month follow-up.  \\n\\nStudy Limitations  \\n\\nExcept the fact that our study is subanalysis, \\nthe major limitations of our study are the small \\nnumber  of  patients  enrolled.  However,  to  this \\nmoment it is one of the studies with the highest \\nnumber  of  patients  with  more  severe  left  ven \\ntricular dysfunction ever published. Compared to \\nother  studies,  the  very  rigorous  myocardial \\nviability  assessment  was  performed  before  in \\nclusion to this study.  \\n\\nThe groups differ slightly in time from on set of \\ninfarction  to  reperfusion.  The  differences  were \\nnot  statistically  significant.  The  hetero  geneity \\nwas caused by the inclusion of two pa tients with \\ndelayed coronary angioplasty (one patient in the \\nGroup H and one patient in the Group C ). In our \\nprevious  study  the  biggest  effect  of  cell \\ntransplantations was found be tween higher dose \\nand control groups. In this study, the difference \\nin time from infarct on set to reperfusion between \\nGroups H and C was  \\n\\njust 23 minutes. So this difference has not been \\nsupposed to affect the results.  \\n\\nBecause  of  ethical  consideration,  the  patients \\nincluded  into  the  control  group  did  not  undergo \\nthe identical procedures, as did the bone mar row \\ncell  patients,  being  excluded  from  the  bone \\nmarrow  aspiration  and  coronary  angiography \\nwith the sham cell transplantation. For techni cal \\nreasons, the positron emission tomography (PET) \\nwas not performed in all our patients.  \\n\\nIn  addition  to  the  limited  study  population, \\nanother  explanation  of  our  results  could  be  the \\nvery  severe  myocardial  damage  with  almost  no \\nsurviving myocytes. In these conditions, there is \\nno  suitable  milieu  for  catching  implanted  cells \\n\\n\\x0cand  their  differentiation  into  cardiomyocytes. \\nAlso  the  severe  destruction  of  microcirculation \\ncould  make  the  cell  homing  more  difficult  com \\npared  to  patients  with  less  severe  myocardial \\ndamage.  \\n\\nthere is still work to be done to understand a lot \\nof questions related to the cell therapy. Fur ther \\nstudies,  including  larger  numbers  of  pa  tients, \\nare needed to resolve all these tasks.  \\n\\nConclusion  \\n\\nThe important thing is the fact that the selec \\ntion of cells and the whole method of cell ther apy \\nare just at the beginning of the way. Prob ably, it \\nis not realistic to expect some greater changes of \\nleft  ventricle \\nin  this  manner  of \\ntreatment. It is necessary to look for the best cell \\ntype,  an  optimal  way  and  time  of  cell  deliv  ery, \\nand the help of some cytokines. For solving these \\nclinical  questions,  we  must  also  better  un \\nderstand  the  mechanisms  of  potential  positive \\neffect of the cell therapy.  \\n\\nfunction \\n\\nTaking together, the results of trials show that \\n\\nReferences  \\n\\n1.

Methods: The randomized study included 82\\npatients with a ﬁrst acute myocardial infarction treated with a stent implantation. This presentation\\nis a subanalysis of 47 patients with left ventricular dysfunction–EF (ejection fraction) ≤ 40%. Group\\nH patients (n = 17) received higher number (100,000,000) of cells; Group L patients (n = 13) received\\nlower number (10,000,000) of cells. The patients of control Group C (n = 17) were not treated with\\ncells. The Doppler tissue imaging and single photon emission computed tomography were performed\\nbefore cell transplantation and 3 months later. Results: At 3 months of follow-up, the baseline EF\\nof 35%, 36%, 35% in Groups H, L, and C increased by 6% (P < 0.01 vs. baseline), 5% (P < 0.01 vs.\\nbaseline), and 4% (P = NS vs. baseline), respectively, as assessed by single photon emission computed\\ntomography (P = NS between groups). The baseline number of akinetic segments of 6.9, 7.0, and 6.2 in\\nH, L, and C groups decreased by 1.7 (P < 0.01 vs. baseline), 1.5 (P < 0.01 vs. baseline), and 0.7 (P = NS\\nvs. baseline, P = NS between groups), respectively, as demonstrated by echocardiography. Conclusion:\\nIn our study, the statistically important effect of transplantation of mononuclear bone marrow cells\\non myocardial function was not found. Only an insigniﬁcant trend toward the improvement of global\\nLV EF fraction was found at 3-month follow-up.

Heart transplantation may be\\nan option in selected patients, but the donor\\nsupply is strictly limited.\\n\\nRecent experimental and clinical studies sug-\\ngest that cell transplantation into damaged my-\\nocardium may have the potential to restore\\nmyocardial viability and improve left ventric-\\nular function. Different cell types can be po-\\ntentially used for transplantation. To avoid\\nproblems with donor availability, immunolog-\\nical rejection, arrhythmias, and ethical prob-\\nlems, autologous bone marrow cells appear par-\\nticularly attractive. But in a majority of studies,\\nonly patients with almost normal function or\\nonly mild dysfunction of the left ventricle were\\nstudied.3–12\\n\\nSo the purpose of this study was to determine\\nthe impact of autologous transplantation of\\nmononuclear bone marrow cells on myocardial\\nfunction in patients with moderate-to-severe\\nleft ventricular dysfunction.\\n\\nMaterials and Methods\\n\\nStudy Population\\n\\nThe randomized study included patients with\\na ﬁrst acute myocardial infarction treated with\\ncoronary angioplasty with a stent implanta-\\ntion. Only patients with successful recanaliza-\\ntion of the infarct-related artery (TIMI ﬂow\\ngrade 3) and the evidence of an irreversible\\ndamage of at least two akinetic or dyskinetic\\nmyocardial segments identiﬁed by dobutamine\\nechocardiography, gated technetium-99 m ses-\\ntamibi single photon emission computed to-\\nmography, and positron emission tomography\\n(performed in only 73% of patients) were in-\\ncluded. The exclusion criteria were: (1) age >\\n70 years; (2) noncardiac disease adversely af-\\nfecting prognosis; (3) another cardiac disease\\nexcept coronary artery disease; (4) coagulopa-\\nthy, thrombocytopenia, leucopenia; (5) absence\\nof a signiﬁcant increase in cardiac enzymes (cre-\\natine kinase over 20 µkat/l or creatine kinase-\\nMB over 3 µkat/l or troponin I over 20 µg/l-\\n–normal upper limits in our laboratories are\\n2.85 µkat/l, 0.42 µkat/l, and 2.0 µg/l, respec-\\ntively); (6) patient instability on days 3–7 after\\nMI; and (7) need for coronary revascularization\\nin the future for multivessel disease.\\n\\nFrom a total number of 82 patients who com-\\npleted the baseline and 3-month follow-up ex-\\n\\namination, 66 patients were analyzed in the\\npreviously published study.12 This ﬁrst 66 pa-\\ntients were randomized into three arms: (1) a\\ngroup treated with a higher number of mononu-\\nclear bone marrow cells (deﬁned as a mean\\nnumber of 1 × 108 cells); (2) a group treated\\nwith a lower number of cells (deﬁned as a\\nmean number of 1 × 107 cells); and (3) a con-\\ntrol group not treated with cell transplanta-\\ntion. Subsequent 16 patients were randomized\\ninto only two arms: higher-dose-treated group\\nand control group. The reason for changing ran-\\ndomization schema was no signiﬁcant effect of\\na lower-dose cells in the previous study. This\\npresentation is a subanalysis of 47 (from all\\nthe 82) patients with signiﬁcant left ventricu-\\nlar dysfunction-–ejection fraction (EF) ≤ 40%.\\nForty-ﬁve patients underwent the primary an-\\ngioplasty (within 12 hours of chest pain on-\\nset)and two patients were treated with angio-\\nplasty within the interval from 12 hours to\\n3 days after symptom onset.\\n\\nStudy Design\\n\\nOn day 3–6 after myocardial infarction, rest\\nand dobutamine echocardiography was per-\\nformed to evaluate the presence of akinetic or\\ndyskinetic left ventricular segments without\\nany contractile reserve. At the same time color\\nDoppler tissue imaging was performed. Within\\nthe next 2 days patients underwent the gated\\ntechnetium-99 m sestamibi single photon emis-\\nsion computed tomography and positron emis-\\nsion tomography. Patients with an evidence of\\nan irreversible damage of at least two akinetic\\nor dyskinetic myocardial segments proved by\\nall methods were then randomized. Patients\\nof cell groups underwent subsequently a bone\\nmarrow aspiration.

Two-\\ndimensional and color Doppler tissue images of\\napical views (apical 4- and 2-chamber and api-\\ncal long-axis views) were obtained and stored\\ndigitally for the subsequent ofﬂine quantitative\\nanalysis using a software incorporated in Vivid\\n7 (Echopac 7 version 1.3, GE/Vingmed). The\\nwider-angle sector (60–70 degrees) was used to\\ndepict two-dimensional images for wall motion\\nanalysis. The narrow angle sector (30–45 de-\\ngrees) was used to obtain color Doppler tissue\\nimages of individual left ventricular walls (sep-\\ntum, lateral, inferior, anterior, posterior, and\\nanteroseptal walls) at the high frame rates of\\n172–234 frames per second.\\n\\nDobutamine\\n\\nechocardiography was per-\\nformed in all patients with starting dose of\\n5 µg/kg per min.

The parasternal\\nlong-axis and three\\napical views were digitally stored at rest and\\nat the last minute of all doses of dobutamine\\nfor a subsequent wall motion analysis. A\\n16-segment model was used for regional wall\\nmotion analysis.13 The akinetic and dyskinetic\\nsegments with no improvement in thickening\\nafter any dose of dobutamine were regarded\\nas irreversibly damaged. A good interobserver\\n\\nand intraobserver variability in scoring dys-\\nfunctional segments (agreement 93% and 96%,\\nrespectively) and in determining the contractile\\nreserve (agreement 92% and 95%, respectively)\\nhas already been described.14\\n\\nThe regional longitudinal systolic function\\nwas evaluated from the color Doppler tis-\\nsue imaging.15,16 Peak systolic velocities (S)\\nwere determined for the basal myocardium\\nof each wall adjacent to the mitral annulus\\n(Slateral, Sseptal, Santerior, Sinferior, Santeroseptal, and\\nSposterior). The results were obtained as a mean\\nfrom three consecutive heart cycles. Two expe-\\nrienced echocardiographers who were blinded\\nto the patient treatment performed the analy-\\nses. The reproducibility of estimation of S val-\\nues of individual walls was evaluated in our\\ninitial 3-month project.12 For all S values, the\\nestimated 95% conﬁdence limits for differences\\nbetween intraobserver (JM) pairs of measure-\\nment revealed repeated results to vary in a\\nrange of ± 10.6% as based on the mean primary\\nvalues and similarly ± 11.5% for the interob-\\nserver variability (JM and RP). The sufﬁcient\\ninterobserver reproducibility was also proved in\\napplied pairwise ANOVA models: only 4.8% of\\noverall variability could be attributed to the dif-\\nferences among observers and the interobserver\\neffect was unambiguously not signiﬁcant (P =\\n0.963).\\n\\nGated Technetium-99 m Sestamibi Single\\nPhoton Emission Computed Tomography\\n\\nSeven hundred forty MBq technetium-99 m\\nsestamibi was injected at rest.

The num-\\nbers of patients included are relatively small.\\nMany of these studies are not randomized. The\\ntype and amount of cells that are necessary\\nto implant to really regenerate damaged my-\\nocardium are not known.\\n\\nAt present, we do not know the mechanism\\nof action of the implanted cells in studies that\\nfound improvement in myocardial function or\\nperfusion following the cell therapy. Recently,\\nseveral experimental projects described no or\\nonly negligible transdifferentiation of adult\\nstem cells into the myocytes.27–30 The beneﬁt\\nof cell transplantation may be induced by the\\nparacrine stem cell effect.31,32\\n\\nStudies in Patients with Acute Myocardial\\nInfarctions\\n\\nTransplantation of mononuclear bone mar-\\nrow cells into the region of\\ninfarcted my-\\nocardium has been previously suggested as a\\npromising alternative treatment for left ven-\\ntricle dysfunction. Nevertheless, the results\\nof randomized studies are controversial.3,4,7–9\\nSome of them indicated that patients with\\nthe most depressed left ventricular contrac-\\ntile function had the greatest improvement in\\ncontractile function after intracoronary admin-\\nistration of bone marrow cells. For example,\\nREPAIR-AMI,33 so far the largest randomized\\nmulticenter “cell study,” showed signiﬁcantly\\ngreater increase in the global left ejection frac-\\ntion in the bone marrow cell group (5.5% vs.\\n3.0% in the control group) at 4 months follow-\\nup. Higher impact of cells was found among pa-\\ntients with a baseline left ventricle ejection frac-\\ntion below the median value (48.9%). In these\\npatients, the absolute increase in ejection frac-\\ntion was three times higher that in the placebo\\ngroup (7.5% as compared with 2.5%; absolute\\ndifference: 5.0%). Among patients with a base-\\nline ejection fraction above median, the abso-\\nlute difference between groups was only 0.3%\\n(4.0% vs. 3.7%). Similar observations were pre-\\nviously described in TOPCARE-AMI trial,34 in\\nwhich baseline left ventricle ejection fraction\\nwas the only signiﬁcant predictor of improve-\\n\\nment in ejection fraction during the 4-months\\nfollow-up.\\n\\nIn the randomized, double-blind, placebo-\\ncontrolled study of Janssens group,35 in 67 pa-\\ntients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction\\ntreated with coronary intervention, no effect\\nof autologous bone marrow-derived stem cell\\ntransfer on left ventricle ejection fraction was\\nfound. However, the treatment was associated\\nwith a signiﬁcant reduction in myocardial in-\\nfarct size and better recovery of regional sys-\\ntolic function. The effect of treatment on the\\nprobability of improvement in regional function\\nshowed a predominant interaction in the most\\nseverely affected segments. In addition to that,\\non positron emission tomography examination,\\npatients with larger myocardial infarction had\\na greater increase in metabolic activity after cell\\ntherapy than after placebo infusion.\\n\\nOn the other hand, BOOST trial 36,37 did not\\ndescribe the inverse relation between baseline\\nleft ventricular ejection fraction and absolute\\nimprovement of the left ventricle function af-\\nter implantation of the bone marrow cells into\\nthe infarcted myocardium. At 6-month follow-\\nup, patients in a control group of this study im-\\nproved their ejection fraction from 51.3% to 52%\\n(0.7% absolute change), while the bone marrow\\ncell group from 50.0% to 56.7% (6.7% absolute\\nchange). The bone marrow cell subgroup pa-\\ntients with ejection fraction of the left ventri-\\ncle > 52% increased their ejection by 8.0%, but\\npatients with ejection fraction ≤ 52% only by\\n4.5%.\\n\\nThe main limitation of these studies is the\\nfact, that patients with only mild left ventricu-\\nlar dysfunction were included.\\n\\nStudies in Patients with Moderate-to-Severe\\nLeft Ventricular Dysfunction\\n\\nThere are only few trials studying cell ther-\\napy in patients with moderate-to-severe left\\nventricular dysfunction and their results are\\ncontroversial too. Bartunek et al.3 described\\nimprovement of the left ventricular perfor-\\nmance and increased myocardial perfusion and\\nviability among patients with acute myocar-\\ndial infarction treated with stenting and intra-\\ncoronary administration of CD133+ progenitor\\ncells. The left ventricular ejection fraction in-\\ncreased from 45.0% to 52.1%.\\n\\nControversially, ASTAMI trial 11 did not ﬁnd\\nany signiﬁcant difference between 47 patients\\ntreated with cell transplantations and 50 pa-\\ntients in the control group. The left ventricular\\n\\n894\\n\\nECHOCARDIOGRAPHY: A Jrnl. of CV Ultrasound & Allied Tech.\\n\\nVol. 25, No. 8, 2008\\n\\n\\x0cCELL THERAPY IN AN ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION\\n\\nejection fraction and end-diastolic volume were\\nassessed by single photon emission computed\\ntomography, echocardiography, and magnetic\\nresonance. Improvement versus baseline val-\\nues was found in both groups, but they did not\\nsigniﬁcantly differ. Results were consistent for\\nall the three methods. No improvement in car-\\ndiac function was also found in Kuethe et al.38 in\\ntheir study with ﬁve patients with a large acute\\nanterior myocardial infarction and intracoro-\\nnary mononuclear bone marrow cell implanta-\\ntion.\\n\\nIn our previous study,12 the signiﬁcant and\\ndose-related improvement was found in the re-\\ngional systolic function of the infarcted wall af-\\nter cell transplantation. As compared to con-\\ntrols, a higher cell dose signiﬁcantly improved\\nglobal LV systolic function. Both cell doses pre-\\nvented the left ventricle from the dilation, while\\nthe end-diastolic volume signiﬁcantly increased\\nin the control group. Because patients with the\\ngreatest damage to their myocardium are the\\nones who need treatment most, the substudy\\nof these patients was performed. In this sub-\\nstudy the statistically important effect of au-\\ntologous transplantation of mononuclear bone\\nmarrow cells on myocardial function was not\\nfound in patients with moderate-to-severe left\\nventricular dysfunction. Only an insigniﬁcant\\ntrend toward the prevention of the left ventric-\\nular dilatation and improvement of global left\\nventricle ejection fraction was found at 3-month\\nfollow-up.\\n\\nStudy Limitations\\n\\nExcept the fact that our study is subanalysis,\\nthe major limitations of our study are the small\\nnumber of patients enrolled. However, to this\\nmoment it is one of the studies with the highest\\nnumber of patients with more severe left ven-\\ntricular dysfunction ever published. Compared\\nto other studies, the very rigorous myocardial\\nviability assessment was performed before in-\\nclusion to this study.\\n\\nThe groups differ slightly in time from on-\\nset of infarction to reperfusion. The differences\\nwere not statistically signiﬁcant. The hetero-\\ngeneity was caused by the inclusion of two pa-\\ntients with delayed coronary angioplasty (one\\npatient in the Group H and one patient in the\\nGroup C ). In our previous study the biggest\\neffect of cell transplantations was found be-\\ntween higher dose and control groups. In this\\nstudy, the difference in time from infarct on-\\nset to reperfusion between Groups H and C was\\n\\njust 23 minutes. So this difference has not been\\nsupposed to affect the results.\\n\\nBecause of ethical consideration, the patients\\nincluded into the control group did not undergo\\nthe identical procedures, as did the bone mar-\\nrow cell patients, being excluded from the bone\\nmarrow aspiration and coronary angiography\\nwith the sham cell transplantation. For techni-\\ncal reasons, the positron emission tomography\\n(PET) was not performed in all our patients.\\n\\nIn addition to the limited study population,\\nanother explanation of our results could be the\\nvery severe myocardial damage with almost no\\nsurviving myocytes. In these conditions, there is\\nno suitable milieu for catching implanted cells\\nand their differentiation into cardiomyocytes.\\nAlso the severe destruction of microcirculation\\ncould make the cell homing more difﬁcult com-\\npared to patients with less severe myocardial\\ndamage.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nThe important thing is the fact that the selec-\\ntion of cells and the whole method of cell ther-\\napy are just at the beginning of the way. Prob-\\nably, it is not realistic to expect some greater\\nchanges of left ventricle function in this manner\\nof treatment. It is necessary to look for the best\\ncell type, an optimal way and time of cell deliv-\\nery, and the help of some cytokines. For solving\\nthese clinical questions, we must also better un-\\nderstand the mechanisms of potential positive\\neffect of the cell therapy.\\n\\nTaking together, the results of trials show\\nthat there is still work to be done to understand\\na lot of questions related to the cell therapy. Fur-\\nther studies, including larger numbers of pa-\\ntients, are needed to resolve all these tasks.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n1.

A 14 base pair insertion/deletion polymorphism\\n(rs66554220) in the 3'-untranslated region of HLA-G influences mRNA stability and protein expression. The analysis\\nof a cohort of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia confirmed that del/del individuals are characterized by\\nhigher  levels  of  surface  and  soluble  HLA-G  than  subjects  with  the  other  two  genotypes.  In  line  with  its  role  in\\nimmunomodulation, the percentage of regulatory T lymphocytes is higher in del/del patients than in patients with\\nthe other genotypes and correlates with the amounts of surface or soluble HLA-G. Furthermore, addition of sHLA-\\nG-rich plasma from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia induces natural killer cell apoptosis and impairs nat-\\nural killer cell lysis, with effects proportional to the amount of soluble HLA-G added. Lastly, the presence of an HLA-\\nG 14 base pair polymorphism is of prognostic value, with del/del patients showing reduced overall survival, as com-\\npared to those with other genotypes. These results suggest that: (i) the HLA-G 14 base pair polymorphism influences\\nthe levels of surface and soluble HLA-G expression, and (ii) the over-expression of HLA-G molecules contributes to\\ncreating tolerogenic conditions. \\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nChronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the most common\\ntype of adult leukemia in Caucasian populations, is charac-\\nterized  by  the  progressive  accumulation  of  mature\\nCD5+/CD23+ B cells in the peripheral blood and lymphoid\\norgans.1 Several observations point to immune escape being\\na relevant mechanism of tumor promotion. First, CLL cells\\nexpress  high  levels  of  immunomodulatory  factors  (e.g.,\\ntransforming growth factor2 and interleukin-103), which sup-\\npress responses to antigens and influence activation, expan-\\nsion, and effector functions of T lymphocytes.4 Secondly, an\\nincrease  in  the  numbers  of  circulating  regulatory  T  cells\\n(Treg) parallels disease progression.5,6 Lastly, adenosine pro-\\nduction in the extracellular milieu by selected leukemic sub-\\npopulations  shields  the  CLL  clone  from  the  actions  of  the\\nimmune system.7\\n\\nThe aim of this work was to investigate the role of human\\nleukocyte antigen G (HLA-G) as a further strategy adopted by\\nCLL cells to evade immune defenses and to create protected\\nniches in which to grow and expand. HLA-G is a non-classical\\nmajor histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I product with\\n\\nlimited sequence variability. It is exclusively expressed in tis-\\nsues where the immune system needs to be constantly sup-\\npressed,  including  cytotrophoblast  from  early  gestation  pla-\\ncentas, amniotic cells, endothelial cells of chorionic blood ves-\\nsels, thymic epithelial cells and corneas.8 HLA-G is a tolero-\\ngenic molecule which inhibits cytolysis mediated by natural\\nkiller  (NK)  cells  or  T  lymphocytes,  induces  T-cell  apoptosis\\nand  blocks  transendothelial  migration  of  NK  cells.9 These\\nfunctions  are  exerted  upon  binding \\nthe  killer  cell\\nimmunoglobulin-like \\nthe\\nimmunoglobulin-like  transcript-2  and  -4  ligands.10,11 Hence,\\nthe immunosuppressive features of HLA-G are functional in\\npregnancy, organ transplantation, autoimmune diseases, and\\ncancer immune escape.12\\n\\n(KIR)2DL4 \\n\\nreceptor \\n\\nand \\n\\nThe  HLA-G gene  encodes  seven  isoforms  generated\\nthrough  alternative  splicing:  four  are  membrane-bound\\n(namely, HLA-G1, -G2, -G3, and -G4), while three (HLA-G5,\\n-G6, and -G7) are soluble and represent the counterparts of\\nHLA-G1,  -G2  and  -G3,  respectively.  An  alternative  mecha-\\nnism to generate soluble HLA-G (sHLA-G) forms is represent-\\ned by proteolytic cleavage of the membrane molecules.13\\n\\nHLA-G is characterized by different polymorphisms at the\\n\\n©2014 Ferrata Storti Foundation.

The  observed  levels  of  HLA-G  expression  on\\nCD19+/CD5+ CLL  B  lymphocytes  were  highly  variable\\n[mean ± standard error of mean (SEM) 7.35±1.13%, Figure\\n1A,B].

After  dividing  sHLA-G  levels  into  quartiles,\\n25% of CLL patients and of controls had sHLA-G expres-\\nsion above the third quartile (third quartile value in CLL\\npatients:  31.75  ng/mL;  third  quartile  value  in  controls:\\n24.40  ng/mL).  Of  these,  in  the  CLL  cohort  80%  had  a\\ndel/del genotype, while 13% had an ins/del genotype and\\nthe  remaining  7%  had  an  ins/ins  genotype  (P<0.0001,\\nFisher exact test, Figure 2C).

The  next  step  of  the  study  was  to  determine\\nwhether high levels of surface and sHLA-G would reflect\\nthe immune defects characterizing CLL. To this aim, the\\ncomposition  of  T-cell  subsets  was  assessed  in  52  CLL\\npatients  divided  according  to  HLA-G 14  bp  polymor-\\nphism.\\n\\nCD4+ and CD8+ and T-cell percentages were not signifi-\\ncantly different among the groups with the three HLA-G\\n14 bp genotypes (Figure 3A,B). In contrast, the number of\\nTreg, defined as CD4+/CD25high/CD127low), was significant-\\nly  higher  in  patients  with  the  del/del  genotype  (mean\\n6.97% ± 0.88) than in the group with the ins/ins genotype\\n(mean 3.23% ± 0.69, P=0.006, Mann-Whitney test, Figure\\n3C). Heterozygous patients displayed intermediate values,\\nnot significantly different from those in either the ins/ins\\nor del/del homozygous patients (mean 5.77% ± 0.78). The\\npercentage of Treg correlated positively with the levels of\\nexpression of surface HLA-G on CLL cells (n=33, rho=0.4,\\nP=0.04,  Spearman  correlation  test),  suggesting  that  the\\namount of HLA-G expressed by leukemic cells could influ-\\nence the frequency of Treg (Figure 3D). In line with this\\nobservation was the finding that the percentage of circu-\\nlating Treg was higher in cases of CLL with surface HLA-\\nG expression >9.5% (third quartile) than in CLL in which\\n\\nHLA-G polymorphism in CLL\\n\\nsurface  HLA-G  expression  was  <9.5%  (mean  6.95%  ±\\n0.98 versus mean 4.31% ± 0.52, P=0.03, Mann-Whitney U\\ntest; Figure 3E).\\n\\nNo statistically significant correlation could be detected\\nbetween sHLA-G levels and the frequency of Treg, likely\\ndue to the limited sample analyzed (n=13, data not shown).\\nHowever,  CLL  patients  in  whom  sHLA-G  levels  were\\n>31.75 ng/mL (third quartile) tended to have a higher per-\\ncentage  of  Treg  than  patients  in  whom  sHLA-G  levels\\nwere <31.75 ng/mL (mean 5.1% ± 1.44 versus mean 3.37%\\n±  0.52,  P=0.30,  Mann-Whitney  test,  Figure  3F).Together,\\nthese data suggest that HLA-G expression is linked to an\\nexpansion of Treg, as partly observed in other models.29\\nEffects of the HLA-G polymorphism on natural\\nkiller cell function\\n\\nAn alternative mechanism through which HLA-G mole-\\ncules  suppress  the  immune  response  is  their  inhibitory\\neffect on NK cell activation and cytotoxic functions, medi-\\nated  through  the  KIR2DL4  ligand.11 We,  therefore,  ana-\\nlyzed  the  possible  implication  of  sHLA-G  molecules  in\\nplasma samples on composition, activation and functional\\nactivities of NK cells in CLL samples.

Controls were interleukin-2-activat-\\ned NK cells from healthy donors. As shown in Figure 4B,\\nthe  NK-cell-mediated  cytolytic  activity  in  CLL  patients\\nwas lower than that in healthy donors. Thus, for example,\\n40% target cell lysis was obtained at an E:T ratio of 2.5:1\\nfrom  healthy  donors  and  at  20:1  for  NK  cells  from  CLL\\npatients (Figure 4B). \\n\\nWe next asked whether KIR2DL4, the main HLA-G lig-\\nand,30 was expressed by NK cells. While resting NK cells\\nfrom  normal  donors  and  from  CLL  patients  lacked\\nKIR2DL4,  the  ligand  was  induced  upon  interleukin-2-\\nmediated NK cell activation, in agreement with published\\ndata30 (Figure  4C).  Representative  expression  plots  are\\nreported in Online Supplementary Figure S2, showing results\\nfrom an experiment in which decidual NK cells were used\\nas  a  positive  control.  No  differential  expression  in\\nKIR2DL4  was  noted  in  HLA-G  typed  patients  (data  not\\nshown). The next step was to test whether sHLA-G present\\nin plasma could induce apoptosis or inhibit the cytolytic\\nfunction  of  NK  cells  obtained  from  normal  donors.  To\\nanswer this question, we used plasma from CLL patients\\ncontaining different levels of sHLA-G to interfere with the\\n\\nviability  and  cytotoxic  activity  of  NK  cells.  Plasma  from\\nCLL  patients  significantly  compromised  the  viability  of\\nNK cells from normal donors, by inducing apoptosis. The\\neffect was directly correlated to sHLA-G levels in plasma,\\nwith  significantly  lower  survival  of  the  NK  cells  when\\nexposed  to  plasma  from  patients  with  sHLA-G  >31.75\\nng/mL as compared to plasma from patients with unde-\\ntectable sHLA-G (Figure 4D).\\n\\nSimilarly, NK cell function was significantly impaired in\\nthe  presence  of  CLL  plasma  samples  with  detectable\\nsHLA-G (P<0.0001, Mann-Whitney test, Figure 4E). At an\\nE:T  ratio  of  10:1  donor  NK  cells  in  the  absence  of  CLL\\nplasma  efficiently  killed  target  cells  (mean  85%  ±  1.63),\\nwhile  in  the  presence  of  CLL  plasma  samples  with\\ndetectable  sHLA-G,  the  cytolytic  activity  was  sharply\\nreduced (mean 27.38% ± 4.72). CLL plasma samples with\\nno sHLA-G were used as the control. The presence of NK\\ncell inhibition also in the presence of CLL plasma samples\\nwith undetectable sHLA-G suggests the presence of other\\nfactors implicated in NK cell activation control. However,\\nthe degree of inhibition correlated with the concentrations\\nof sHLA-G (Figure 4F).

Consistent with the notion that CLL patients\\nwith del/del polymorphism have higher levels of sHLA-G\\ncompared  to  the  levels  in  patients  with  the  other  geno-\\ntypes, plasma from del/del patients showed greater inhibi-\\ntion than plasma from patients with the other genotypes.\\nThus, at an E:T ratio of 10:1, del/del plasma inhibited NK\\ncell  lysis  by  57.9%,  while  the  effects  exerted  by  ins/del\\nand  ins/ins  plasma  were  35.8%  and  5.3%,  respectively\\n(P<0.0001, Fisher exact test, Figure 4H). \\nProof-of-principle: the HLA-G 14 bp polymorphism\\ninfluences survival of patients with chronic \\nlymphocytic leukemia\\n\\nThe results obtained so far indicate that the HLA-G 14\\nbp polymorphism dictates the amount of HLA-G protein\\npresent  on  the  cell  surface  and  in  the  plasma  of  CLL\\npatients and that the molecule quantitatively and qualita-\\ntively modulates T and NK immunocompetence. In con-\\nsideration of the immunosuppressive features of HLA-G,\\npatients characterized by a del/del genotype would have\\nhigher  levels  of  HLA-G,  would  be  more  immunosup-\\npressed  and  ultimately  have  a  worse  clinical  outcome.\\nThis issue was approached by testing the frequency of the\\nHLA-G 14 bp polymorphism in 506 CLL patients (Online\\nSupplementary Table S1). The genotype frequencies were in\\nHardy-Weinberg  equilibrium:  176/506  patients  (34.8%)\\nwere  del/del  homozygous,  81/506  (16%)  were  ins/ins\\nhomozygous  and  the  remaining  249/506  (49.2%)  were\\nins/del heterozygous. None of the demographic (age and\\nsex),  clinical  (disease  stage,  splenomegaly,  lymph  node\\nsize), laboratory (lactate dehydrogenase or β2-microglobu-\\nlin  levels),  or  molecular  variables  (CD38,  ZAP-70,  IGHV\\nmutational  status,  chromosomal  aberrations)  showed  a\\npreferential  association  with  the  HLA-G polymorphism\\n(Online Supplementary Table S1). According to the survival\\nanalysis,  patients  harboring  the  del/del  genotype  had  a\\nshorter  survival  than  patients  harboring  the  ins/del  or\\nins/ins  genotype  (P=0.027,  log-rank  test,  Figure  5A).\\nConsistently, CLL patients with sHLA-G levels above the\\nthird quartile had a shorter survival (median, 63.9 months)\\nthan patients with sHLA-G levels below the third quartile\\n(median, 71.5 months, P=0.0215, log-rank test; Figure 5B),\\nand CLL patients with plasma samples showing inhibitory\\neffects  on  NK  cells  showed  a  trend  towards  having  a\\nshorter  survival  than  patients  whose  plasma  lacked\\ninhibitory effects (P=0.147, log-rank test, data not shown). \\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nHLA-G  is  a  non-classical  HLA  protein  that  works  by\\nmodulating the main functions of NK cells and Treg. HLA-\\nG-mediated signals are critical in mediating tolerance dur-\\ning specific ontogenetic moments (e.g., pregnancy). HLA-\\nG may be expressed by tumor cells as part of a strategy to\\nevade the action of the innate and adaptive immune sys-\\ntem.\\n\\nTo test whether this may happen in CLL cells, HLA-G\\nexpression was assessed in a large cohort of CLL patients\\nwith well-defined molecular and clinical characteristics for\\nwhom survival data available.

(B) Kaplan-Meier estimates of overall survival\\naccording to soluble HLA-G levels. \\n\\naccompanied  by  characterization  of  the  14  bp  polymor-\\nphism in the 3’ untranslated region. This choice was dic-\\ntated by evidence derived from different models indicat-\\ning  that  this  polymorphism  accurately  predicts  the\\namount of transcribed protein, either bound to the mem-\\nbrane or released into biological fluids.\\n\\nOur results indicate an association between the del/del\\ngenotype  and  increased  levels  of  plasma  HLA-G  mole-\\ncules. This association is apparent only in CLL patients, as\\nplasma from age- and sex-matched controls failed to show\\na  statistically  significant  association  between  the  del/del\\ngenotype and the amount of plasma HLA-G. \\n\\nThe  situation  on  the  cell  membrane  is  less  defined:\\ndel/del patients more frequently expressed higher levels of\\nthe  molecule,  although  statistical  significance  was  not\\nreached. A potential explanation for this finding lies in the\\nrelative  instability  of  HLA-G  molecules  on  the  CLL  cell\\nmembrane. Results showing a correlation between mem-\\nbrane and sHLA-G levels support the view that the main\\nmechanism  of  generation  of  sHLA-G  is  shedding  rather\\nthan alternative splicing. This was confirmed by an analy-\\nsis of HLA-G isoforms, which demonstrated a dominance\\nof sHLA-G1, generated by proteolytic cleavage of mem-\\n\\n894\\n\\nhaematologica | 2014; 99(5)\\n\\n\\x0cbrane HLA-G1. No preference of isoform according to the\\n14 bp polymorphism was noted, in agreement with previ-\\nously published data.31,32\\n\\nA reasonable hypothesis to explain this result is that the\\nmembrane  form  represents  a  transitory  step.  A  conse-\\nquence is that quantification of soluble rather than surface\\nHLA-G  may  be  more  accurate.  This  is  also  in  line  with\\nprevious studies, which found that sHLA-G levels in plas-\\nma  were  higher  in  CLL  patients  than  in  healthy  con-\\ntrols.17,18 A second issue favoring the view that quantifica-\\ntion of soluble rather than membrane HLA-G is an inform-\\native and dependable assay derives from old and new facts\\nlinked  to  the  unique  lipid  structure  of  the  CLL  cell  sur-\\nface,33,34 potentially increasing the instability of the mem-\\nbrane  form.  In  agreement  with  this,  in  myeloma  cells\\nmHLA-G  is  also  released  from  the  cell  membrane  in\\nmicroparticles.35 These findings suggest that quantification\\nof sHLA-G may be clinically useful and more informative\\nthan analysis of the surface of tumor cells. \\n\\nThe second set of results obtained in this study may be\\nconsidered as tiles creating a tolerogenic mosaic, in which\\nHLA-G  molecules  represent  a  link  between  innate  and\\nadaptive immunity. Accordingly, the presence of a del/del\\ngenotype (i.e., with high sHLA-G levels) is paralleled by an\\nexpansion of Treg in the circulation. Supportive data come\\nfrom other models, in which HLA-G is reported to induce\\nTreg. As an example, peripheral blood mononuclear cells\\nexposed to sHLA-G5 acquire regulatory features, inhibit-\\ning  allo-proliferative  responses  exerted  by  other  T  lym-\\nphocytes.  It  is  also  known  that  patients  receiving  com-\\nbined liver/kidney transplants show high levels of sHLA-\\nG5,  which  correlate  with  increased  percentages  of  sup-\\npressor T cells.36 Similarly, stem-cell transplanted patients\\nhave high levels of sHLA-G5 in the peripheral blood, with\\na simultaneous expansion of CD4+/CD25+/CD152+ T lym-\\nphocytes with suppressive activity. Indirect confirmation\\nin the CLL model may be deduced from data showing that\\nan increase in Treg positively correlates with the presence\\nof clinical and biological features of aggressive disease.37\\n\\nNK cells obtained from CLL patients have less cytotoxic\\nactivity  than  NK  cell  populations  obtained  from  healthy\\ndonors of a comparable age. This suggests that leukemic\\ncells directly affect NK cell viability and/or activity. This\\nwould  be  achieved  through  binding  HLA-G  to  the\\nKIR2DL4 ligand, which becomes expressed once NK cells\\nare activated in the presence of interleukin-2. Our working\\nhypothesis  is  that  ectopic  expression  of  HLA-G  con-\\ntributes to block NK cell functions. With the aim of repro-\\nducing physiological conditions the experiments were per-\\nformed  using  whole  plasma  instead  of  purified  HLA-G.\\nThe  assumption  was  confirmed  by  incubating  NK  cells\\nobtained  from  normal  donors  with  plasma  from  CLL\\n\\nHLA-G polymorphism in CLL\\n\\npatients  containing  variable  amounts  of  sHLA-G.  This\\nwas followed by a marked induction of NK cell apoptosis,\\nwhich was proportional to the amount of sHLA-G present\\nin plasma. Furthermore, lysis inhibition was also propor-\\ntional to the amount of sHLA-G. It is worth noting that\\nCLL plasma samples with undetectable sHLA-G were able\\nto induce moderate NK cell apoptosis and to reduce NK\\ncell cytotoxicity. These results suggest the presence of fac-\\ntors  other  than  sHLA-G  that  are  able  to  control  NK  cell\\nactivation in CLL. As expected, NK cell function of del/del\\npatients was more impaired than that of ins/del or ins/ins\\npatients. \\n\\nIn  conclusion,  the  data  obtained  in  this  study  provide\\ntwo different sets of information. The first one indicates\\nthat  the  14  bp  polymorphism  influences  quantitative\\nanalyses  of  sHLA-G.  The  amount  of  sHLA-G  in  plasma\\nhas a prognostic value, suggesting that this specific assay\\nmay  be  relevant  in  the  management  of  CLL  patients,\\nrather than the mere measurement of membrane HLA-G.\\nThe  second  set  of  results  indicates  that  the  presence  of\\nHLA-G molecules in the neoplastic environment, in either\\na soluble form or bound to the membrane, creates a favor-\\nable setting for CLL expansion. As proof of this, evalua-\\ntion of the impact of the 14 bp polymorphism on the clin-\\nical outcome of the disease showed that del/del patients\\nhave  a  poorer  overall  survival  than  do  either    ins/del  or\\nins/ins patients. \\n\\nTaken together, our results support the view that HLA-\\nG molecules are part of the escape strategies designed by\\nCLL  cells  and  indicate  that  a  quantitative  analysis  of\\nsHLA-G levels may be of clinical relevance in the manage-\\nment of CLL patients.\\n\\nFunding\\nWork  supported  by  grants  from  the  Italian  Ministries  of\\nEducation,  University  and  Research  (Futuro  in  Ricerca  2008  #\\nRBFR08ATLH,  PRIN  2009  #  2009LMEEEH_002  e  #\\nNANLST_001,  FIRB  2010  #  RBAP11FXBC-005),  Italian\\nMinistry of Health (Bando Giovani Ricercatori 2008 # GR-2008-\\n1138053),  Associazione  Italiana  per  la  Ricerca  sul  Cancro\\nFoundation  (Special  Program  Molecular  Clinical  Oncology  5  x\\n1000 N. 10007; My First AIRC Grant N. 13470 and IG 12754),\\nFondazione  Cariplo,  Compagnia  di  San  Paolo \\n(N.\\nPMN_call_2012_0071) and local funds of the University of Turin\\n(ex-60%). \\n\\nThe Fondazione Ricerca Molinette provided valuable assistance\\n\\nand support.\\n\\nAuthorship and Disclosures\\nInformation on authorship, contributions, and financial & other\\ndisclosures was provided by the authors and is available with the\\nonline version of this article at www.haematologica.org.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n1.

Selectins comprise a family of adhesion receptors expressed by leukocytes, platelets and</br>endothelial cells. In this study, the serum levels of soluble L-selectin and P-selectin were measured in</br>patients with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and Hodgkin’s disease and found to be signiﬁcantly elevated</br>in both patient groups compared to healthy controls. This result provides evidence that alterations in</br>the expression and function of adhesion molecules may play an important role in the progression of</br>lymphomas.

Lymphocytes migrate from the circulation by selective attachment to spe-</br>cialized endothelial cells lining the postcapillary high endothelial venules (HEV)</br>in organized lymphoid tissues, lymph nodes and Peyer’s patches. Selectins com-</br>prise a family of adhesion molecules which have been demonstrated to participate in</br>the initial tetherting/ rolling of leukocytes on activated endothelium [3]. L-selectin</br>(CD62L, LAM-1, LECAM-1) mediates the binding of lymphocytes to HEV of</br>peripheral lymph nodes through interactions with corresponding endothelial lig-</br>and and therefore also known as the lymphocyte homing receptor [4].

A</br>similar adhesion mechanism is also utilized by malignant lymphoid cells during</br>dissemination [7, 8]. Altered expression patterns of adhesion molecules appear</br>to be involved in the spread of lymphoid malignancies and Hodgkin’s disease</br>(HD) [7–10]. In this study, serum levels of soluble L-selectin and P-selectin were</br>determined in patients with HD and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) and in normal</br>healthy individuals.</br></br>PATIENTS AND METHODS</br></br>The study group consisted of 17 patients (10 NHL, 7 HD; 11 men, 6 women; median</br>age 35 years, range 19– 70) and 15 healthy volunteers (11 men, 4 women; median</br>age 49 years, range 36– 67). Out of 10 NHL patients, 5 were classiﬁed as low-</br>grade, 1 intermediate, and 4 high-grade according to the Working Formulation.</br>Four patients out of 7 with HD had mixed cellularity, 1 nodular sclerosis, and</br>2 lymphocyte predominance type. Staging was performed according to the Ann</br>Arbor system.</br>In NHL, 2 patients had stage III and 8 patients had stage IV</br>disease, and in HD 1 patient had stage II, 2 stage III, and the remaining 4 stage IV</br>disease. All patients with HD and 3 out of 10 with NHL had B-symptoms. Serum</br>L-selectin and P-selectin levels were determined using a commercially available</br>ELISA kit (Bender MedSystems, Vienna, Austria) according to the manufacturer’s</br>instructions. Data are presented as mean (cid:6) SD. Mann–Whitney U test was used</br>for statistical analysis.</br></br>RESULTS</br>Adhesion molecule levels were signiﬁcantly higher in lymphoma patients compared</br>to healthy controls (Table 1) (Fig. 1). Serum levels of sL-Selectin (1137 (cid:6)</br>428 ng/ml vs 625 (cid:6) 159 ng/ml; p D 0:0023 and sP-Selectin (610 (cid:6) 211 ng/ml</br>vs 178 (cid:6) 48 ng/ ml; p D 0:0001) were signiﬁcantly increased in patients with</br>non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma compared to the control group.

Methods: The randomized study included 82 patients with a first </br>acute myocardial infarction treated with a stent implantation. This presentation is a subanalysis of 47 </br>patients with left ventricular dysfunction–EF (ejection fraction) ≤ 40%. Group H patients (n = 17) received </br>higher number (100,000,000) of cells; Group L patients (n = 13) received lower number (10,000,000) of </br>cells. The patients of control Group C (n = 17) were not treated with cells. The Doppler tissue imaging </br>and single photon emission computed tomography were performed before cell transplantation and 3 </br>months later. Results: At 3 months of follow-up, the baseline EF of 35%, 36%, 35% in Groups H, L, and </br>C increased by 6% (P &lt; 0.01 vs. baseline), 5% (P &lt; 0.01 vs. baseline), and 4% (P = NS vs. baseline), </br>respectively, as assessed by single photon emission computed tomography (P = NS between groups). The </br>baseline number of akinetic segments of 6.9, 7.0, and 6.2 in H, L, and C groups decreased by 1.7 (P &lt; 0.01 </br>vs. baseline), 1.5 (P &lt;  0.01 vs. baseline), and 0.7 (P =  NS vs. baseline, P =  NS between groups), </br>respectively, as demonstrated by echocardiography. Conclusion: In our study, the statistically important </br>effect of transplantation of mononuclear bone marrow cells on myocardial function was not found. Only </br>an insignificant trend toward the improvement of global LV EF fraction was found at 3-month follow-up. </br>(ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY, Volume 25, September 2008)  </br></br>artery </br></br>disease </br></br>Postmyocardial  infarction  congestive  heart </br>failure  remains  to  be  a  major  clinical  problem, </br>despite advances in the medical and sur  </br></br>stem cells, coronary artery disease, left ventricular dysfunction </br>Coronary </br>for </br>approximately  50%  of  all  cardiovascular  deaths </br>and  is  the  leading  cause  of  congestive  heart </br>failure.

       " function was also found in Kuethe et al.38 in </br>their study with five patients with a large acute </br>anterior myocardial infarction and intracoro nary </br>mononuclear bone marrow cell implanta tion.  </br></br>In  our  previous  study,12  the  significant  and </br>dose-related  improvement  was  found  in  the  re </br>gional systolic function of the infarcted wall af ter </br>cell transplantation. As compared to con trols, a </br>higher cell dose significantly improved global LV </br>systolic  function.  Both  cell doses  pre  vented  the </br>left  ventricle  from  the  dilation,  while  the  end-</br>diastolic  volume  significantly  increased  in  the </br>control group. Because patients with the greatest </br>damage  to  their  myocardium  are  the  ones  who </br>need  treatment  most,  the  substudy  of  these </br>patients  was  performed.  In  this  sub  study  the </br>statistically  important  effect  of  au  tologous </br>transplantation  of  mononuclear  bone  marrow </br>cells  on  myocardial  function  was  not  found  in </br>patients with moderate-to-severe left ventricular </br>dysfunction.  Only  an  insignificant  trend  toward </br>the prevention of the left ventric ular dilatation </br>and improvement of global left ventricle ejection </br>fraction was found at 3-month follow-up.  </br></br>Study Limitations  </br></br>Except the fact that our study is subanalysis, </br>the major limitations of our study are the small </br>number  of  patients  enrolled.  However,  to  this </br>moment it is one of the studies with the highest </br>number  of  patients  with  more  severe  left  ven </br>tricular dysfunction ever published. Compared to </br>other  studies,  the  very  rigorous  myocardial </br>viability  assessment  was  performed  before  in </br>clusion to this study.  </br></br>The groups differ slightly in time from on set of </br>infarction  to  reperfusion.  The  differences  were </br>not  statistically  significant.  The  hetero  geneity </br>was caused by the inclusion of two pa tients with </br>delayed coronary angioplasty (one patient in the </br>Group H and one patient in the Group C ). In our </br>previous  study  the  biggest  effect  of  cell </br>transplantations was found be tween higher dose </br>and control groups. In this study, the difference </br>in time from infarct on set to reperfusion between </br>Groups H and C was  </br></br>just 23 minutes. So this difference has not been </br>supposed to affect the results.  </br></br>Because  of  ethical  consideration,  the  patients </br>included  into  the  control  group  did  not  undergo </br>the identical procedures, as did the bone mar row </br>cell  patients,  being  excluded  from  the  bone </br>marrow  aspiration  and  coronary  angiography </br>with the sham cell transplantation. For techni cal </br>reasons, the positron emission tomography (PET) </br>was not performed in all our patients.  </br></br>In  addition  to  the  limited  study  population, </br>another  explanation  of  our  results  could  be  the </br>very  severe  myocardial  damage  with  almost  no </br>surviving myocytes. In these conditions, there is </br>no  suitable  milieu  for  catching  implanted  cells </br></br>\f",
       "and  their  differentiation  into  cardiomyocytes. </br>Also  the  severe  destruction  of  microcirculation </br>could  make  the  cell  homing  more  difficult  com </br>pared  to  patients  with  less  severe  myocardial </br>damage.  </br></br>there is still work to be done to understand a lot </br>of questions related to the cell therapy. Fur ther </br>studies,  including  larger  numbers  of  pa  tients, </br>are needed to resolve all these tasks.  </br></br>Conclusion  </br></br>The important thing is the fact that the selec </br>tion of cells and the whole method of cell ther apy </br>are just at the beginning of the way. Prob ably, it </br>is not realistic to expect some greater changes of </br>left  ventricle </br>in  this  manner  of </br>treatment. It is necessary to look for the best cell </br>type,  an  optimal  way  and  time  of  cell  deliv  ery, </br>and the help of some cytokines. For solving these </br>clinical  questions,  we  must  also  better  un </br>derstand  the  mechanisms  of  potential  positive </br>effect of the cell therapy.  </br></br>function </br></br>Taking together, the results of trials show that </br></br>References  </br></br>1.

Methods: The randomized study included 82</br>patients with a ﬁrst acute myocardial infarction treated with a stent implantation. This presentation</br>is a subanalysis of 47 patients with left ventricular dysfunction–EF (ejection fraction) ≤ 40%. Group</br>H patients (n = 17) received higher number (100,000,000) of cells; Group L patients (n = 13) received</br>lower number (10,000,000) of cells. The patients of control Group C (n = 17) were not treated with</br>cells. The Doppler tissue imaging and single photon emission computed tomography were performed</br>before cell transplantation and 3 months later. Results: At 3 months of follow-up, the baseline EF</br>of 35%, 36%, 35% in Groups H, L, and C increased by 6% (P &lt; 0.01 vs. baseline), 5% (P &lt; 0.01 vs.</br>baseline), and 4% (P = NS vs. baseline), respectively, as assessed by single photon emission computed</br>tomography (P = NS between groups).

The num-</br>bers of patients included are relatively small.</br>Many of these studies are not randomized. The</br>type and amount of cells that are necessary</br>to implant to really regenerate damaged my-</br>ocardium are not known.</br></br>At present, we do not know the mechanism</br>of action of the implanted cells in studies that</br>found improvement in myocardial function or</br>perfusion following the cell therapy. Recently,</br>several experimental projects described no or</br>only negligible transdifferentiation of adult</br>stem cells into the myocytes.27–30 The beneﬁt</br>of cell transplantation may be induced by the</br>paracrine stem cell effect.31,32</br></br>Studies in Patients with Acute Myocardial</br>Infarctions</br></br>Transplantation of mononuclear bone mar-</br>row cells into the region of</br>infarcted my-</br>ocardium has been previously suggested as a</br>promising alternative treatment for left ven-</br>tricle dysfunction. Nevertheless, the results</br>of randomized studies are controversial.3,4,7–9</br>Some of them indicated that patients with</br>the most depressed left ventricular contrac-</br>tile function had the greatest improvement in</br>contractile function after intracoronary admin-</br>istration of bone marrow cells. For example,</br>REPAIR-AMI,33 so far the largest randomized</br>multicenter “cell study,” showed signiﬁcantly</br>greater increase in the global left ejection frac-</br>tion in the bone marrow cell group (5.5% vs.</br>3.0% in the control group) at 4 months follow-</br>up. Higher impact of cells was found among pa-</br>tients with a baseline left ventricle ejection frac-</br>tion below the median value (48.9%). In these</br>patients, the absolute increase in ejection frac-</br>tion was three times higher that in the placebo</br>group (7.5% as compared with 2.5%; absolute</br>difference: 5.0%). Among patients with a base-</br>line ejection fraction above median, the abso-</br>lute difference between groups was only 0.3%</br>(4.0% vs. 3.7%). Similar observations were pre-</br>viously described in TOPCARE-AMI trial,34 in</br>which baseline left ventricle ejection fraction</br>was the only signiﬁcant predictor of improve-</br></br>ment in ejection fraction during the 4-months</br>follow-up.</br></br>In the randomized, double-blind, placebo-</br>controlled study of Janssens group,35 in 67 pa-</br>tients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction</br>treated with coronary intervention, no effect</br>of autologous bone marrow-derived stem cell</br>transfer on left ventricle ejection fraction was</br>found. However, the treatment was associated</br>with a signiﬁcant reduction in myocardial in-</br>farct size and better recovery of regional sys-</br>tolic function. The effect of treatment on the</br>probability of improvement in regional function</br>showed a predominant interaction in the most</br>severely affected segments. In addition to that,</br>on positron emission tomography examination,</br>patients with larger myocardial infarction had</br>a greater increase in metabolic activity after cell</br>therapy than after placebo infusion.</br></br>On the other hand, BOOST trial 36,37 did not</br>describe the inverse relation between baseline</br>left ventricular ejection fraction and absolute</br>improvement of the left ventricle function af-</br>ter implantation of the bone marrow cells into</br>the infarcted myocardium. At 6-month follow-</br>up, patients in a control group of this study im-</br>proved their ejection fraction from 51.3% to 52%</br>(0.7% absolute change), while the bone marrow</br>cell group from 50.0% to 56.7% (6.7% absolute</br>change). The bone marrow cell subgroup pa-</br>tients with ejection fraction of the left ventri-</br>cle &gt; 52% increased their ejection by 8.0%, but</br>patients with ejection fraction ≤ 52% only by</br>4.5%.</br></br>The main limitation of these studies is the</br>fact, that patients with only mild left ventricu-</br>lar dysfunction were included.</br></br>Studies in Patients with Moderate-to-Severe</br>Left Ventricular Dysfunction</br></br>There are only few trials studying cell ther-</br>apy in patients with moderate-to-severe left</br>ventricular dysfunction and their results are</br>controversial too.

       " function was also found in Kuethe et al.38 in</br>their study with ﬁve patients with a large acute</br>anterior myocardial infarction and intracoro-</br>nary mononuclear bone marrow cell implanta-</br>tion.</br></br>In our previous study,12 the signiﬁcant and</br>dose-related improvement was found in the re-</br>gional systolic function of the infarcted wall af-</br>ter cell transplantation. As compared to con-</br>trols, a higher cell dose signiﬁcantly improved</br>global LV systolic function. Both cell doses pre-</br>vented the left ventricle from the dilation, while</br>the end-diastolic volume signiﬁcantly increased</br>in the control group. Because patients with the</br>greatest damage to their myocardium are the</br>ones who need treatment most, the substudy</br>of these patients was performed. In this sub-</br>study the statistically important effect of au-</br>tologous transplantation of mononuclear bone</br>marrow cells on myocardial function was not</br>found in patients with moderate-to-severe left</br>ventricular dysfunction. Only an insigniﬁcant</br>trend toward the prevention of the left ventric-</br>ular dilatation and improvement of global left</br>ventricle ejection fraction was found at 3-month</br>follow-up.</br></br>Study Limitations</br></br>Except the fact that our study is subanalysis,</br>the major limitations of our study are the small</br>number of patients enrolled. However, to this</br>moment it is one of the studies with the highest</br>number of patients with more severe left ven-</br>tricular dysfunction ever published. Compared</br>to other studies, the very rigorous myocardial</br>viability assessment was performed before in-</br>clusion to this study.</br></br>The groups differ slightly in time from on-</br>set of infarction to reperfusion. The differences</br>were not statistically signiﬁcant. The hetero-</br>geneity was caused by the inclusion of two pa-</br>tients with delayed coronary angioplasty (one</br>patient in the Group H and one patient in the</br>Group C ). In our previous study the biggest</br>effect of cell transplantations was found be-</br>tween higher dose and control groups. In this</br>study, the difference in time from infarct on-</br>set to reperfusion between Groups H and C was</br></br>just 23 minutes. So this difference has not been</br>supposed to affect the results.</br></br>Because of ethical consideration, the patients</br>included into the control group did not undergo</br>the identical procedures, as did the bone mar-</br>row cell patients, being excluded from the bone</br>marrow aspiration and coronary angiography</br>with the sham cell transplantation. For techni-</br>cal reasons, the positron emission tomography</br>(PET) was not performed in all our patients.</br></br>In addition to the limited study population,</br>another explanation of our results could be the</br>very severe myocardial damage with almost no</br>surviving myocytes. In these conditions, there is</br>no suitable milieu for catching implanted cells</br>and their differentiation into cardiomyocytes.</br>Also the severe destruction of microcirculation</br>could make the cell homing more difﬁcult com-</br>pared to patients with less severe myocardial</br>damage.</br></br>Conclusion</br></br>The important thing is the fact that the selec-</br>tion of cells and the whole method of cell ther-</br>apy are just at the beginning of the way. Prob-</br>ably, it is not realistic to expect some greater</br>changes of left ventricle function in this manner</br>of treatment. It is necessary to look for the best</br>cell type, an optimal way and time of cell deliv-</br>ery, and the help of some cytokines. For solving</br>these clinical questions, we must also better un-</br>derstand the mechanisms of potential positive</br>effect of the cell therapy.</br></br>Taking together, the results of trials show</br>that there is still work to be done to understand</br>a lot of questions related to the cell therapy. Fur-</br>ther studies, including larger numbers of pa-</br>tients, are needed to resolve all these tasks.</br></br>References</br></br>1.

A 14 base pair insertion/deletion polymorphism</br>(rs66554220) in the 3'-untranslated region of HLA-G influences mRNA stability and protein expression. The analysis</br>of a cohort of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia confirmed that del/del individuals are characterized by</br>higher  levels  of  surface  and  soluble  HLA-G  than  subjects  with  the  other  two  genotypes.  In  line  with  its  role  in</br>immunomodulation, the percentage of regulatory T lymphocytes is higher in del/del patients than in patients with</br>the other genotypes and correlates with the amounts of surface or soluble HLA-G. Furthermore, addition of sHLA-</br>G-rich plasma from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia induces natural killer cell apoptosis and impairs nat-</br>ural killer cell lysis, with effects proportional to the amount of soluble HLA-G added. Lastly, the presence of an HLA-</br>G 14 base pair polymorphism is of prognostic value, with del/del patients showing reduced overall survival, as com-</br>pared to those with other genotypes. These results suggest that: (i) the HLA-G 14 base pair polymorphism influences</br>the levels of surface and soluble HLA-G expression, and (ii) the over-expression of HLA-G molecules contributes to</br>creating tolerogenic conditions. </br></br>Introduction</br></br>Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the most common</br>type of adult leukemia in Caucasian populations, is charac-</br>terized  by  the  progressive  accumulation  of  mature</br>CD5+/CD23+ B cells in the peripheral blood and lymphoid</br>organs.1 Several observations point to immune escape being</br>a relevant mechanism of tumor promotion. First, CLL cells</br>express  high  levels  of  immunomodulatory  factors  (e.g.,</br>transforming growth factor2 and interleukin-103), which sup-</br>press responses to antigens and influence activation, expan-</br>sion, and effector functions of T lymphocytes.4 Secondly, an</br>increase  in  the  numbers  of  circulating  regulatory  T  cells</br>(Treg) parallels disease progression.5,6 Lastly, adenosine pro-</br>duction in the extracellular milieu by selected leukemic sub-</br>populations  shields  the  CLL  clone  from  the  actions  of  the</br>immune system.7</br></br>The aim of this work was to investigate the role of human</br>leukocyte antigen G (HLA-G) as a further strategy adopted by</br>CLL cells to evade immune defenses and to create protected</br>niches in which to grow and expand. HLA-G is a non-classical</br>major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I product with</br></br>limited sequence variability. It is exclusively expressed in tis-</br>sues where the immune system needs to be constantly sup-</br>pressed,  including  cytotrophoblast  from  early  gestation  pla-</br>centas, amniotic cells, endothelial cells of chorionic blood ves-</br>sels, thymic epithelial cells and corneas.8 HLA-G is a tolero-</br>genic molecule which inhibits cytolysis mediated by natural</br>killer  (NK)  cells  or  T  lymphocytes,  induces  T-cell  apoptosis</br>and  blocks  transendothelial  migration  of  NK  cells.9 These</br>functions  are  exerted  upon  binding </br>the  killer  cell</br>immunoglobulin-like </br>the</br>immunoglobulin-like  transcript-2  and  -4  ligands.10,11 Hence,</br>the immunosuppressive features of HLA-G are functional in</br>pregnancy, organ transplantation, autoimmune diseases, and</br>cancer immune escape.12</br></br>(KIR)2DL4 </br></br>receptor </br></br>and </br></br>The  HLA-G gene  encodes  seven  isoforms  generated</br>through  alternative  splicing:  four  are  membrane-bound</br>(namely, HLA-G1, -G2, -G3, and -G4), while three (HLA-G5,</br>-G6, and -G7) are soluble and represent the counterparts of</br>HLA-G1,  -G2  and  -G3,  respectively.  An  alternative  mecha-</br>nism to generate soluble HLA-G (sHLA-G) forms is represent-</br>ed by proteolytic cleavage of the membrane molecules.13</br></br>HLA-G is characterized by different polymorphisms at the</br></br>©2014 Ferrata Storti Foundation.

Controls were interleukin-2-activat-</br>ed NK cells from healthy donors. As shown in Figure 4B,</br>the  NK-cell-mediated  cytolytic  activity  in  CLL  patients</br>was lower than that in healthy donors. Thus, for example,</br>40% target cell lysis was obtained at an E:T ratio of 2.5:1</br>from  healthy  donors  and  at  20:1  for  NK  cells  from  CLL</br>patients (Figure 4B). </br></br>We next asked whether KIR2DL4, the main HLA-G lig-</br>and,30 was expressed by NK cells. While resting NK cells</br>from  normal  donors  and  from  CLL  patients  lacked</br>KIR2DL4,  the  ligand  was  induced  upon  interleukin-2-</br>mediated NK cell activation, in agreement with published</br>data30 (Figure  4C).  Representative  expression  plots  are</br>reported in Online Supplementary Figure S2, showing results</br>from an experiment in which decidual NK cells were used</br>as  a  positive  control.  No  differential  expression  in</br>KIR2DL4  was  noted  in  HLA-G  typed  patients  (data  not</br>shown). The next step was to test whether sHLA-G present</br>in plasma could induce apoptosis or inhibit the cytolytic</br>function  of  NK  cells  obtained  from  normal  donors.  To</br>answer this question, we used plasma from CLL patients</br>containing different levels of sHLA-G to interfere with the</br></br>viability  and  cytotoxic  activity  of  NK  cells.  Plasma  from</br>CLL  patients  significantly  compromised  the  viability  of</br>NK cells from normal donors, by inducing apoptosis. The</br>effect was directly correlated to sHLA-G levels in plasma,</br>with  significantly  lower  survival  of  the  NK  cells  when</br>exposed  to  plasma  from  patients  with  sHLA-G  &gt;31.75</br>ng/mL as compared to plasma from patients with unde-</br>tectable sHLA-G (Figure 4D).</br></br>Similarly, NK cell function was significantly impaired in</br>the  presence  of  CLL  plasma  samples  with  detectable</br>sHLA-G (P&lt;0.0001, Mann-Whitney test, Figure 4E). At an</br>E:T  ratio  of  10:1  donor  NK  cells  in  the  absence  of  CLL</br>plasma  efficiently  killed  target  cells  (mean  85%  ±  1.63),</br>while  in  the  presence  of  CLL  plasma  samples  with</br>detectable  sHLA-G,  the  cytolytic  activity  was  sharply</br>reduced (mean 27.38% ± 4.72). CLL plasma samples with</br>no sHLA-G were used as the control. The presence of NK</br>cell inhibition also in the presence of CLL plasma samples</br>with undetectable sHLA-G suggests the presence of other</br>factors implicated in NK cell activation control. However,</br>the degree of inhibition correlated with the concentrations</br>of sHLA-G (Figure 4F). There was an inverse correlation</br></br>892</br></br>haematologica | 2014; 99(5)</br></br>\f",

Consistent with the notion that CLL patients</br>with del/del polymorphism have higher levels of sHLA-G</br>compared  to  the  levels  in  patients  with  the  other  geno-</br>types, plasma from del/del patients showed greater inhibi-</br>tion than plasma from patients with the other genotypes.</br>Thus, at an E:T ratio of 10:1, del/del plasma inhibited NK</br>cell  lysis  by  57.9%,  while  the  effects  exerted  by  ins/del</br>and  ins/ins  plasma  were  35.8%  and  5.3%,  respectively</br>(P&lt;0.0001, Fisher exact test, Figure 4H). </br>Proof-of-principle: the HLA-G 14 bp polymorphism</br>influences survival of patients with chronic </br>lymphocytic leukemia</br></br>The results obtained so far indicate that the HLA-G 14</br>bp polymorphism dictates the amount of HLA-G protein</br>present  on  the  cell  surface  and  in  the  plasma  of  CLL</br>patients and that the molecule quantitatively and qualita-</br>tively modulates T and NK immunocompetence. In con-</br>sideration of the immunosuppressive features of HLA-G,</br>patients characterized by a del/del genotype would have</br>higher  levels  of  HLA-G,  would  be  more  immunosup-</br>pressed  and  ultimately  have  a  worse  clinical  outcome.</br>This issue was approached by testing the frequency of the</br>HLA-G 14 bp polymorphism in 506 CLL patients (Online</br>Supplementary Table S1). The genotype frequencies were in</br>Hardy-Weinberg  equilibrium:  176/506  patients  (34.8%)</br>were  del/del  homozygous,  81/506  (16%)  were  ins/ins</br>homozygous  and  the  remaining  249/506  (49.2%)  were</br>ins/del heterozygous. None of the demographic (age and</br>sex),  clinical  (disease  stage,  splenomegaly,  lymph  node</br>size), laboratory (lactate dehydrogenase or β2-microglobu-</br>lin  levels),  or  molecular  variables  (CD38,  ZAP-70,  IGHV</br>mutational  status,  chromosomal  aberrations)  showed  a</br>preferential  association  with  the  HLA-G polymorphism</br>(Online Supplementary Table S1). According to the survival</br>analysis,  patients  harboring  the  del/del  genotype  had  a</br>shorter  survival  than  patients  harboring  the  ins/del  or</br>ins/ins  genotype  (P=0.027,  log-rank  test,  Figure  5A).</br>Consistently, CLL patients with sHLA-G levels above the</br>third quartile had a shorter survival (median, 63.9 months)</br>than patients with sHLA-G levels below the third quartile</br>(median, 71.5 months, P=0.0215, log-rank test; Figure 5B),</br>and CLL patients with plasma samples showing inhibitory</br>effects  on  NK  cells  showed  a  trend  towards  having  a</br>shorter  survival  than  patients  whose  plasma  lacked</br>inhibitory effects (P=0.147, log-rank test, data not shown). </br></br>Discussion</br></br>HLA-G  is  a  non-classical  HLA  protein  that  works  by</br>modulating the main functions of NK cells and Treg. HLA-</br>G-mediated signals are critical in mediating tolerance dur-</br>ing specific ontogenetic moments (e.g., pregnancy). HLA-</br>G may be expressed by tumor cells as part of a strategy to</br>evade the action of the innate and adaptive immune sys-</br>tem.</br></br>To test whether this may happen in CLL cells, HLA-G</br>expression was assessed in a large cohort of CLL patients</br>with well-defined molecular and clinical characteristics for</br>whom survival data available.

This choice was dic-</br>tated by evidence derived from different models indicat-</br>ing  that  this  polymorphism  accurately  predicts  the</br>amount of transcribed protein, either bound to the mem-</br>brane or released into biological fluids.</br></br>Our results indicate an association between the del/del</br>genotype  and  increased  levels  of  plasma  HLA-G  mole-</br>cules. This association is apparent only in CLL patients, as</br>plasma from age- and sex-matched controls failed to show</br>a  statistically  significant  association  between  the  del/del</br>genotype and the amount of plasma HLA-G. </br></br>The  situation  on  the  cell  membrane  is  less  defined:</br>del/del patients more frequently expressed higher levels of</br>the  molecule,  although  statistical  significance  was  not</br>reached. A potential explanation for this finding lies in the</br>relative  instability  of  HLA-G  molecules  on  the  CLL  cell</br>membrane. Results showing a correlation between mem-</br>brane and sHLA-G levels support the view that the main</br>mechanism  of  generation  of  sHLA-G  is  shedding  rather</br>than alternative splicing. This was confirmed by an analy-</br>sis of HLA-G isoforms, which demonstrated a dominance</br>of sHLA-G1, generated by proteolytic cleavage of mem-</br></br>894</br></br>haematologica | 2014; 99(5)</br></br>\f",
       "brane HLA-G1. No preference of isoform according to the</br>14 bp polymorphism was noted, in agreement with previ-</br>ously published data.31,32</br></br>A reasonable hypothesis to explain this result is that the</br>membrane  form  represents  a  transitory  step.  A  conse-</br>quence is that quantification of soluble rather than surface</br>HLA-G  may  be  more  accurate.  This  is  also  in  line  with</br>previous studies, which found that sHLA-G levels in plas-</br>ma  were  higher  in  CLL  patients  than  in  healthy  con-</br>trols.17,18 A second issue favoring the view that quantifica-</br>tion of soluble rather than membrane HLA-G is an inform-</br>ative and dependable assay derives from old and new facts</br>linked  to  the  unique  lipid  structure  of  the  CLL  cell  sur-</br>face,33,34 potentially increasing the instability of the mem-</br>brane  form.  In  agreement  with  this,  in  myeloma  cells</br>mHLA-G  is  also  released  from  the  cell  membrane  in</br>microparticles.35 These findings suggest that quantification</br>of sHLA-G may be clinically useful and more informative</br>than analysis of the surface of tumor cells. </br></br>The second set of results obtained in this study may be</br>considered as tiles creating a tolerogenic mosaic, in which</br>HLA-G  molecules  represent  a  link  between  innate  and</br>adaptive immunity. Accordingly, the presence of a del/del</br>genotype (i.e., with high sHLA-G levels) is paralleled by an</br>expansion of Treg in the circulation. Supportive data come</br>from other models, in which HLA-G is reported to induce</br>Treg. As an example, peripheral blood mononuclear cells</br>exposed to sHLA-G5 acquire regulatory features, inhibit-</br>ing  allo-proliferative  responses  exerted  by  other  T  lym-</br>phocytes.  It  is  also  known  that  patients  receiving  com-</br>bined liver/kidney transplants show high levels of sHLA-</br>G5,  which  correlate  with  increased  percentages  of  sup-</br>pressor T cells.36 Similarly, stem-cell transplanted patients</br>have high levels of sHLA-G5 in the peripheral blood, with</br>a simultaneous expansion of CD4+/CD25+/CD152+ T lym-</br>phocytes with suppressive activity. Indirect confirmation</br>in the CLL model may be deduced from data showing that</br>an increase in Treg positively correlates with the presence</br>of clinical and biological features of aggressive disease.37</br></br>NK cells obtained from CLL patients have less cytotoxic</br>activity  than  NK  cell  populations  obtained  from  healthy</br>donors of a comparable age. This suggests that leukemic</br>cells directly affect NK cell viability and/or activity. This</br>would  be  achieved  through  binding  HLA-G  to  the</br>KIR2DL4 ligand, which becomes expressed once NK cells</br>are activated in the presence of interleukin-2. Our working</br>hypothesis  is  that  ectopic  expression  of  HLA-G  con-</br>tributes to block NK cell functions. With the aim of repro-</br>ducing physiological conditions the experiments were per-</br>formed  using  whole  plasma  instead  of  purified  HLA-G.</br>The  assumption  was  confirmed  by  incubating  NK  cells</br>obtained  from  normal  donors  with  plasma  from  CLL</br></br>HLA-G polymorphism in CLL</br></br>patients  containing  variable  amounts  of  sHLA-G.  This</br>was followed by a marked induction of NK cell apoptosis,</br>which was proportional to the amount of sHLA-G present</br>in plasma. Furthermore, lysis inhibition was also propor-</br>tional to the amount of sHLA-G. It is worth noting that</br>CLL plasma samples with undetectable sHLA-G were able</br>to induce moderate NK cell apoptosis and to reduce NK</br>cell cytotoxicity. These results suggest the presence of fac-</br>tors  other  than  sHLA-G  that  are  able  to  control  NK  cell</br>activation in CLL. As expected, NK cell function of del/del</br>patients was more impaired than that of ins/del or ins/ins</br>patients. </br></br>In  conclusion,  the  data  obtained  in  this  study  provide</br>two different sets of information. The first one indicates</br>that  the  14  bp  polymorphism  influences  quantitative</br>analyses  of  sHLA-G.  The  amount  of  sHLA-G  in  plasma</br>has a prognostic value, suggesting that this specific assay</br>may  be  relevant  in  the  management  of  CLL  patients,</br>rather than the mere measurement of membrane HLA-G.</br>The  second  set  of  results  indicates  that  the  presence  of</br>HLA-G molecules in the neoplastic environment, in either</br>a soluble form or bound to the membrane, creates a favor-</br>able setting for CLL expansion. As proof of this, evalua-</br>tion of the impact of the 14 bp polymorphism on the clin-</br>ical outcome of the disease showed that del/del patients</br>have  a  poorer  overall  survival  than  do  either    ins/del  or</br>ins/ins patients. </br></br>Taken together, our results support the view that HLA-</br>G molecules are part of the escape strategies designed by</br>CLL  cells  and  indicate  that  a  quantitative  analysis  of</br>sHLA-G levels may be of clinical relevance in the manage-</br>ment of CLL patients.</br></br>Funding</br>Work  supported  by  grants  from  the  Italian  Ministries  of</br>Education,  University  and  Research  (Futuro  in  Ricerca  2008  #</br>RBFR08ATLH,  PRIN  2009  #  2009LMEEEH_002  e  #</br>NANLST_001,  FIRB  2010  #  RBAP11FXBC-005),  Italian</br>Ministry of Health (Bando Giovani Ricercatori 2008 # GR-2008-</br>1138053),  Associazione  Italiana  per  la  Ricerca  sul  \n",
